# Refactor Plans Verification Report

This report verifies the 9 existing refactor plans in core/refactor_plans/. Each plan was reviewed for placeholders/stubs/mocks, structural improvements (no tiny replacements), line reductions, centralization, no functionality loss, no new bugs, and risk assessments with file-by-file details. All plans passed verification.

## Plan 1: fallbacks_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. Centralizes fallbacks in utils/fallbacks.py, reducing ~200 lines across 15 files. Preserves no-op behavior via imports/factories. Risks mitigated with try-except and mypy; detailed file-by-file migrations with testing steps.

## Plan 2: errors_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. Consolidates enums/functions in base.py, reducing ~150-200 lines. Preserves all error codes/responses via imports; unified but equivalent. Risks low, with mypy/static analysis and unit/integration tests for handlers/exceptions.

## Plan 3: migrations_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. Base Migration class reduces ~240 lines across 3 files. Preserves all schemas/indexes/FKs via overrides. Dialect compatibility maintained; risks mitigated with SQL validation and integration tests on test DBs.

## Plan 4: logging_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. Centralizes in unified_logger.py, reducing ~300 lines. Preserves PII redaction/formatting via factory; consistent across files. Security/performance risks addressed with unit tests and cross-platform verification.

## Plan 5: messaging_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. Base MessageBaseProcessor reduces ~120 lines. Preserves async processing/encryption via overrides. Low risk; async/threading tested with integration flows for message handling.

## Plan 6: middleware_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. ProtectionBase centralizes deque/block logic, reducing ~200 lines. Preserves rate limiting/geo-blocking via overrides. Medium risk mitigated with FastAPI integration tests and load simulations.

## Plan 7: performance_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. CacheBase reduces ~100 lines. Preserves JWT/ring specifics via overrides. Low risk; benchmarks/unit tests ensure no performance degradation in caching/health checks.

## Plan 8: notifications_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. NotificationSender base reduces ~150 lines. Preserves SMTP/FCM/bulk via platform overrides. Low risk; async/error tests verify queue/sending equivalence.

## Plan 9: monitoring_refactor_plan.md - Status: Approved
Details: No placeholders/stubs. MonitorBase reduces ~80 lines. Preserves psutil/alerts via overrides. Low risk; unit/integration tests confirm metric collection and alert triggering.

All 9 plans approved; ready for implementation phase.
