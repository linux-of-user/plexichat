## System Description

### Architecture Overview

The P2P Sharded Backup & Distribution system encrypts database content into 1MB immutable shards with different keys per shard. Shards are distributed across peer nodes to prevent any single peer from receiving complementary shards for the same logical data.

**Key Components:**
- **Backup Engine**: Orchestrates backup creation, encryption, and sharding
- **Encryption Service**: Provides AES-256-GCM encryption with quantum-ready algorithms
- **Storage Manager**: Handles multi-cloud storage with redundancy
- **Quantum Encryption Manager**: Implements post-quantum cryptography
- **P2P Distribution Layer**: Manages peer-to-peer shard distribution

## Conclusion

The P2P Sharded Backup & Distribution system presents unique security challenges due to its distributed nature and privacy requirements. While the current architecture provides strong protection against many traditional threats, the identified risks require ongoing monitoring and mitigation strategy updates, particularly regarding quantum computing threats and privacy-preserving technologies.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Implement post-quantum cryptography immediately
2. Deploy comprehensive peer reputation and behavior monitoring
3. Establish regular threat model updates and security assessments
4. Develop privacy-preserving metadata handling mechanisms

This threat model serves as the foundation for secure implementation of the P2P sharded backup system and should be reviewed quarterly or when significant architectural changes occur.
