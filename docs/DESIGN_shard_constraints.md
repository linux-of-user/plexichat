**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-31
**Author:** Kilo Code
**Phase:** X (P2P Sharded Backup & Distribution)
**Scope:** Security and privacy constraints for shard distribution and recovery

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive constraints and rules for the P2P Sharded Backup & Distribution system in PlexiChat. The design ensures security, privacy, and availability while mitigating identified threats from the threat model. All designs align with the existing architecture using encrypted 1MB shards, server-side hashes, immutable shards, per-shard unique keys, intentional partial shards for privacy, and partial recovery/versioning capabilities.

## 1. Complementary Shard Isolation Rules

### Core Principle
No single peer shall receive both complementary shards that could reconstruct the same logical data unit, preventing single-point data reconstruction attacks.

### Shard Classification Rules

#### Logical Data Unit Definition
- **Primary Shards**: Contain encrypted data segments (â‰ˆ1MB each)
- **Parity Shards**: Contain erasure-coded redundancy for recovery
- **Metadata Shards**: Contain integrity hashes and distribution metadata
- **Complementary Pairs**: Shards that together enable data reconstruction

#### Distribution Constraints
```mermaid

    A[Logical Data Unit] --> B[Split into N Shards]
    B --> C[Primary Shard 1]
    B --> D[Primary Shard 2]
    B --> E[Parity Shard 1]
    B --> F[Parity Shard 2]
    
    C --> G[Peer Group A]
    D --> H[Peer Group B]
    E --> I[Peer Group C]
    F --> J[Peer Group D]
    
    G -.->|No Overlap| H
    I -.->|No Overlap| J
    G -.->|No Overlap| I
    H -.->|No Overlap| J
```

#### Isolation Enforcement
1. **Peer Group Assignment**: Each shard type assigned to mutually exclusive peer groups
2. **Geographic Separation**: Complementary shards distributed across different geographic regions
3. **Network Segmentation**: Shards isolated at network level using different communication channels
4. **Temporal Separation**: Complementary shards distributed at different times with random delays

### Security Implications
- **Prevents Reconstruction Attacks**: Single compromised peer cannot reconstruct data
- **Mitigates Collusion**: Multiple peers required for reconstruction
- **Reduces Attack Surface**: Isolated shard access patterns

## 2. Shard Distribution Strategies

### Randomness Requirements

#### Cryptographic Randomness
- **Seed Generation**: Use HKDF-SHA256 with system entropy for distribution seeds
- **Peer Selection**: Cryptographically secure random selection from eligible peer pool
- **Timing Randomization**: Random delays (1-60 seconds) between shard distributions

#### Deterministic Components
- **Consistent Hashing**: Deterministic peer selection based on shard ID
- **Load Balancing**: Weighted random selection based on peer capacity and reliability
- **Geographic Optimization**: Deterministic geographic distribution with random peer selection within regions

### Assignment Algorithm
