# ADR 011: Complete File Management Security Scanning

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The file management system has core upload/download functionality but security scanning is incomplete (80% complete). This creates security vulnerabilities in file handling within the existing plugin and interface structures.

## Decision
Complete file management security scanning by implementing comprehensive file validation, malware detection, and access controls. All changes will be made within existing `plugins/file_manager/` and `interfaces/web/routers/files.py` without altering the overall architecture.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Enhanced security for file operations, malware prevention, access control
- **Negative:** Increased processing overhead, potential upload delays
- **Risks:** False positives in scanning, performance impact
- **Mitigation:** Configurable scanning levels, performance monitoring

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement comprehensive file type validation
2. Add malware scanning integration
3. Enhance access control mechanisms
4. Add file integrity verification
5. Implement quarantine system for suspicious files
6. Add security event logging for file operations
7. Update file upload/download workflows
8. Add configurable security policies

## Migration and Rollback Procedures
- **Migration:** Enable scanning features incrementally
- **Rollback:** Disable advanced scanning, revert to basic validation
- **Testing:** File scanning test suites with various file types

## Testing and Validation Criteria
- Unit tests for scanning algorithms
- Integration tests for file upload workflows
- Security tests for malware detection
- Performance tests for scanning overhead
- False positive/negative rate validation
- Access control enforcement tests

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Malware bypass, unauthorized file access
- **Medium Risk:** Performance degradation, false positives
- **Low Risk:** Backward compatibility with existing files

## Alternatives Considered
- Third-party scanning service (rejected due to architectural consistency)
- Minimal scanning (rejected due to security requirements)
