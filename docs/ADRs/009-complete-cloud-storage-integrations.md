# ADR 009: Complete Cloud Storage Integrations

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The storage manager supports multi-cloud storage but integrations are partial (70% complete). AWS S3, Azure, and GCP integrations need completion for full cloud storage functionality within the existing `features/backup/` module structure.

## Decision
Complete cloud storage integrations by implementing full AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage support with failover, geo-redundancy, and cost optimization. All changes will be contained within `features/backup/storage_manager.py` without altering the overall architecture.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Reliable multi-cloud storage, improved data durability, cost optimization
- **Negative:** Increased complexity, cloud provider dependencies
- **Risks:** Cloud service outages, data transfer costs, security configurations
- **Mitigation:** Multi-provider redundancy, cost monitoring, security reviews

## Implementation Plan
1. Complete AWS S3 integration with advanced features
2. Implement full Azure Blob Storage support
3. Add Google Cloud Storage integration
4. Implement storage location failover mechanisms
5. Add geo-redundancy and cross-region replication
6. Implement cost optimization strategies
7. Add storage performance monitoring
8. Update storage manager for unified cloud operations

## Migration and Rollback Procedures
- **Migration:** Enable cloud providers incrementally with testing
- **Rollback:** Fallback to local storage, disable cloud integrations
- **Testing:** Cloud-specific test environments and mock services

## Testing and Validation Criteria
- Unit tests for each cloud provider SDK
- Integration tests for cloud storage operations
- Failover and redundancy tests
- Performance tests for data transfer
- Security tests for cloud credentials
- Cost monitoring validation

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Cloud credential exposure, data loss during transfers
- **Medium Risk:** Provider API changes, service outages
- **Low Risk:** Local storage fallback available

## Alternatives Considered
- Single cloud provider (rejected due to vendor lock-in)
- Third-party storage abstraction (rejected due to architectural consistency)
