# ADR 008: Complete AI Provider Integrations

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The AI integration system has a core abstraction layer implemented but provider integrations are partial (70% complete). Multiple AI providers have placeholder implementations, preventing full utilization of AI-powered features within the existing `features/ai/` module structure.

## Decision
Complete AI provider integrations by implementing all provider APIs, adding failover mechanisms, and enhancing content moderation. All changes will be made within the existing `features/ai/` modules without altering the overall architecture.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Full AI feature functionality, improved content moderation, provider redundancy
- **Negative:** Increased API complexity, potential rate limiting issues
- **Risks:** API key security, provider dependency, cost overruns
- **Mitigation:** Secure key management, rate limiting, cost monitoring

## Implementation Plan
1. Complete OpenAI API integration in `features/ai/providers/`
2. Implement Anthropic Claude provider
3. Add Google Gemini provider support
4. Enhance provider failover and load balancing
5. Complete content moderation service
6. Add AI feature monitoring and metrics
7. Implement provider-specific optimizations
8. Update AI abstraction layer for new providers

## Migration and Rollback Procedures
- **Migration:** Gradual rollout of providers with feature flags
- **Rollback:** Disable new providers, revert to existing implementations
- **Testing:** Provider-specific testing environments

## Testing and Validation Criteria
- Unit tests for each provider integration
- Integration tests for AI features
- Content moderation accuracy tests
- Performance tests for API calls
- Security tests for API key handling
- Failover mechanism tests

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** API key exposure, content moderation failures
- **Medium Risk:** Provider API changes, rate limiting
- **Low Risk:** Backward compatibility maintained

## Alternatives Considered
- Single provider focus (rejected due to redundancy requirements)
- Third-party AI service (rejected due to architectural consistency)
