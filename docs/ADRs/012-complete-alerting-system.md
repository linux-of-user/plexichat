# ADR 012: Complete Alerting System Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The monitoring system has basic metrics collection but the alerting system is incomplete (70% complete). This prevents proactive issue detection and response within the existing `core/monitoring/` and `core/performance/` modules.

## Decision
Complete the alerting system by implementing comprehensive alert rules, notification channels, and escalation procedures. All changes will be made within the existing monitoring modules without altering the overall architecture.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Proactive issue detection, improved system reliability, faster response times
- **Negative:** Alert noise potential, increased monitoring complexity
- **Risks:** Alert fatigue, missed critical alerts
- **Mitigation:** Configurable alert thresholds, alert prioritization

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement comprehensive alert rule engine
2. Add multiple notification channels (email, SMS, Slack)
3. Create alert escalation procedures
4. Add alert aggregation and correlation
5. Implement alert acknowledgment and tracking
6. Add alert history and analytics
7. Create alert dashboard and management interface
8. Update monitoring documentation

## Migration and Rollback Procedures
- **Migration:** Enable alerting features incrementally
- **Rollback:** Disable alerts, maintain basic monitoring
- **Testing:** Alert simulation and testing environments

## Testing and Validation Criteria
- Unit tests for alert rule logic
- Integration tests for notification channels
- Alert accuracy and false positive tests
- Escalation procedure validation
- Performance tests for alert processing
- User acceptance testing for alert management

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Missed critical alerts, alert overload
- **Medium Risk:** Notification failures, configuration errors
- **Low Risk:** Backward compatibility with existing monitoring

## Alternatives Considered
- Third-party alerting service (rejected due to architectural consistency)
- Basic alerting only (rejected due to monitoring requirements)
