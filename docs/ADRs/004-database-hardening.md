# ADR 004: Database Hardening and Migration System

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The database layer has several critical gaps identified in the audit: underdeveloped migration system, missing database constraints, no indexes for performance-critical queries, and lack of partitioning strategy. These issues affect data integrity, performance, and scalability.

## Decision
Implement comprehensive database hardening including proper constraints, indexes, migration system with rollback support, and performance optimization. Add database-level security measures and monitoring.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Improved data integrity, better performance, reliable migrations
- **Negative:** Database downtime during schema changes, increased complexity
- **Risks:** Data loss during migration, performance degradation
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, backup verification, phased rollout

## Implementation Plan
1. Add missing foreign key constraints and check constraints
2. Create composite indexes for query optimization
3. Implement migration system with rollback support
4. Add database-level encryption and access controls
5. Implement partitioning for large tables
6. Add performance monitoring and query profiling

## Alternatives Considered
- Minimal database changes (rejected due to integrity risks)
- External database management (rejected due to architectural consistency)
