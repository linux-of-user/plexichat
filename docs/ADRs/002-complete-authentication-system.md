# ADR 002: Complete Authentication System Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The authentication system contains incomplete implementations across multiple components. The CLI authentication uses hardcoded tokens, and the UnifiedAuthManager has placeholder implementations for critical authentication providers. This creates security vulnerabilities and prevents proper multi-factor authentication and OAuth integration.

## Decision
Complete the authentication system by implementing all authentication providers, removing hardcoded credentials, and ensuring proper session management and MFA support. Integrate with the unified security system for comprehensive authentication flow.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Secure authentication across all interfaces, proper MFA support, OAuth integration
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in authentication flows, potential migration of existing sessions
- **Risks:** Authentication failures during transition, user lockouts
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout with fallback mechanisms, comprehensive testing

## Implementation Plan
1. Remove hardcoded tokens from CLI authentication
2. Complete OAuth provider implementations
3. Implement biometric authentication
4. Add device fingerprinting and tracking
5. Complete MFA flows with TOTP and hardware keys
6. Integrate risk-based authentication
7. Add comprehensive testing for all auth flows

## Alternatives Considered
- Minimal authentication (rejected due to security requirements)
- Third-party authentication service (rejected due to architectural consistency)
