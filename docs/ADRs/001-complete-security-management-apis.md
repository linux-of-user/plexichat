# ADR 001: Complete Security Management APIs Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The security management APIs in `interfaces/web/routers/security_management.py` contain 8 TODO items representing incomplete implementations of critical security functions. These include authentication, rate limiting status, security policy management, and audit log retrieval. The current placeholder implementations pose significant security risks and prevent proper administrative control.

## Decision
Implement all placeholder security management endpoints with proper validation, error handling, and integration with the unified security system. Replace hardcoded values with dynamic configurations and ensure all operations are properly authenticated and authorized.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Complete security management capabilities, elimination of security gaps
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in API endpoints, potential for breaking changes if not carefully implemented
- **Risks:** Authentication bypass if implementation is incomplete
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and security review before deployment

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement proper authentication flow for admin endpoints
2. Add rate limiting status retrieval with real-time metrics
3. Complete security policy CRUD operations
4. Implement audit log retrieval with filtering and pagination
5. Add comprehensive input validation and error handling
6. Update API documentation

## Alternatives Considered
- Leave as placeholders (rejected due to security risks)
- Implement minimal versions (rejected due to incomplete functionality)
