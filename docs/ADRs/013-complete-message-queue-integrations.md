# ADR 013: Complete Message Queue Integrations

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The message queue system supports multiple backends but integrations are incomplete (75% complete). Full Redis, RabbitMQ, and Kafka support is needed for reliable async processing within the existing `core/messaging/` and `infrastructure/services/` modules.

## Decision
Complete message queue integrations by implementing full support for Redis, RabbitMQ, and Kafka with failover, monitoring, and performance optimization. All changes will be made within the existing messaging modules without altering the overall architecture.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Reliable async processing, improved scalability, message persistence
- **Negative:** Increased complexity, broker dependencies
- **Risks:** Message loss, broker failures, performance overhead
- **Mitigation:** Multi-broker support, monitoring, comprehensive testing

## Implementation Plan
1. Complete Redis queue integration with advanced features
2. Implement full RabbitMQ support with clustering
3. Add comprehensive Kafka integration
4. Implement queue failover and load balancing
5. Add message persistence and reliability features
6. Create queue monitoring and metrics
7. Add dead letter queue handling
8. Update message routing and processing

## Migration and Rollback Procedures
- **Migration:** Enable queue backends incrementally
- **Rollback:** Fallback to basic in-memory queuing
- **Testing:** Queue-specific test environments and load testing

## Testing and Validation Criteria
- Unit tests for each queue backend
- Integration tests for message processing
- Performance tests for high-throughput scenarios
- Failover and recovery tests
- Message persistence validation
- Cross-queue compatibility tests

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Message loss during failures, processing delays
- **Medium Risk:** Broker configuration complexity, resource consumption
- **Low Risk:** Backward compatibility with existing messaging

## Alternatives Considered
- Single queue backend (rejected due to flexibility requirements)
- Third-party queue service (rejected due to architectural consistency)
