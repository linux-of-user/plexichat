# ADR 010: Complete Clustering Failover Mechanisms

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The clustering system has basic node management implemented but failover mechanisms are incomplete (70% complete). This affects system reliability and high availability within the existing `core/clustering/` module structure.

## Decision
Complete clustering failover mechanisms by implementing comprehensive node health monitoring, automatic failover procedures, and cluster coordination. All changes will be made within the existing `core/clustering/` modules without altering the overall architecture.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** Improved system reliability, automatic failover, high availability
- **Negative:** Increased complexity, potential split-brain scenarios
- **Risks:** Service disruption during failover, data consistency issues
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, monitoring, gradual rollout

## Implementation Plan
1. Enhance node health monitoring in `core/clustering/cluster_manager.py`
2. Implement automatic failover procedures
3. Add cluster coordination and consensus mechanisms
4. Complete load balancing algorithms
5. Add cluster state management and persistence
6. Implement split-brain prevention
7. Add failover testing and simulation
8. Update clustering documentation

## Migration and Rollback Procedures
- **Migration:** Enable failover features incrementally per cluster
- **Rollback:** Disable automatic failover, manual intervention required
- **Testing:** Cluster simulation environments for testing

## Testing and Validation Criteria
- Unit tests for failover logic
- Integration tests for cluster operations
- Chaos engineering for node failures
- Performance tests under failure conditions
- Data consistency validation during failover
- Split-brain scenario testing

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Data loss during failover, service unavailability
- **Medium Risk:** Split-brain scenarios, performance impact
- **Low Risk:** Backward compatibility with single-node operation

## Alternatives Considered
- Manual failover only (rejected due to availability requirements)
- Third-party clustering solution (rejected due to architectural consistency)
