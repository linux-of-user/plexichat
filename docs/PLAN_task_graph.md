## Conclusion

This task graph provides a structured approach to transforming the PlexiChat backend from a partially implemented system to a production-ready, secure, and fully tested platform.

**Total Estimated Duration:** 12 weeks  
**Critical Path:** A1 → A2 → B1 → X1 → X3 → C1 → F1 → G1 → G3  
**Parallel Streams:** Security hardening can proceed alongside P2P implementation  
**Risk Level:** Medium (mitigated by incremental approach and comprehensive testing)</content>
