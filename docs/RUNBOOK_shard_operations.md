# Operational Runbook: P2P Sharded Backup & Distribution System

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-31
**Phase:** X (Operational Documentation)
**Author:** Kilo Code
**Scope:** Production operations for P2P sharded backup system

## Overview

This runbook provides comprehensive operational procedures for managing the P2P Sharded Backup & Distribution system in production. The system distributes encrypted 1MB shards across peer nodes using AES-256-GCM encryption with complementary shard separation to prevent data reconstruction by individual peers.

**Key System Components:**
- **ShardManager**: Handles data sharding and integrity verification
- **BackupManager**: Orchestrates backup creation and restoration
- **EncryptionManager**: Manages per-shard encryption keys
- **P2P Distribution Layer**: Manages peer-to-peer shard distribution
- **StorageManager**: Handles multi-cloud storage integration

## Routine Operations
