# PlexiChat Compilation Analysis and QEMU Enablement Plan

## Introduction

The PlexiChat project is a sophisticated FastAPI-based backend application leveraging async/await patterns, SQLAlchemy 2.0 for ORM, PostgreSQL in production, and SQLite for development. Current build and compilation processes rely on standard Python tooling (pyproject.toml for configuration, pip for dependency management, Makefile for development tasks), but lack advanced compilation analysis, native code optimization for performance-critical paths (e.g., clustering, P2P messaging, security modules), and systematic error handling in build pipelines. Additionally, while the project supports clustering and sharding for scalability, there is no integrated support for cross-platform emulation or virtualization testing using QEMU, which is essential for validating deployments on diverse architectures (e.g., ARM for edge devices, x86_64 for cloud) and ensuring compatibility in emulated environments for features like P2P sharded backups and plugin isolation.

This plan addresses these gaps by outlining a comprehensive strategy for enhancing compilation processes with performance optimizations and integrating QEMU for robust testing and deployment. The focus is on maintaining the project's architecture (core business logic, infrastructure services, interfaces, plugins, shared utilities) while introducing non-intrusive enhancements that align with conventions: full type hints, async I/O, Black formatting (88-char lines), and 80% test coverage via pytest with asyncio.

## Compilation Analysis Section

### Current Build Process Analysis

The existing build ecosystem includes:
- **pyproject.toml**: Configures project metadata, dependencies, and build tools (e.g., Ruff for linting, Black for formatting, MyPy for type checking). It enables editable installs via `pip install -e ".[dev]"` but lacks directives for native compilation or optimization flags.
- **requirements.txt and requirements-minimal.txt**: List dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, pytest-asyncio, etc.), but no pinned versions for reproducible builds or separation of runtime vs. build-time deps.
- **Makefile**: Provides development targets (e.g., `make docs-serve`, `ruff check src/ --fix`, `black src/`, `pytest tests/`, `uvicorn plexichat.main:app --reload`). No targets for compilation benchmarking, native builds, or error analysis in async/SQLAlchemy pipelines.
- **Gaps Identified**:
  - No native compilation: Pure Python execution limits performance in hot paths like `core/clustering/cluster_manager.py` (async node discovery) or `core/security/unified_hsm_manager.py` (quantum-resistant crypto).
  - Missing optimization for async code: No profiling of event loop contention in FastAPI endpoints or SQLAlchemy query compilation under load.
  - Error handling deficiencies: Build process does not catch compilation-time issues (e.g., SQLAlchemy dialect mismatches between SQLite dev and PostgreSQL prod) or async deadlocks during packaging.
  - Lack of static analysis extension: MyPy/Ruff focus on runtime types/linting, but no checks for build-time compatibility (e.g., Windows vs. Linux path handling in `infrastructure/utils/security.py`).
  - No load testing for compilation: Packaging (e.g., via `python -m build`) untested under simulated production loads, risking incomplete wheels or missing async deps.

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Cython/Numba Integration for Performance-Critical Paths**:
   - Target modules: `core/threading/thread_manager.py` (async thread pooling), `core/security/pqc_extensions.py` (post-quantum crypto), `core/clustering/node_manager.py` (P2P discovery). Place supporting utilities in `src/plexichat/infrastructure/utils/compilation.py`.
   - Implementation: Annotate hot functions with `@cython.compile` or `@numba.jit(nopython=True)` for JIT compilation. For async compatibility, use Cython's async support or wrap in thread pools.
   - Benefits: Up to 10x speedup in CPU-bound tasks without altering API signatures. Ensure type hints remain via MyPy stubs.
   - Integration: Add Cython/Numba to pyproject.toml under `[build-system]` and create `setup.py` for extension building.

#### Detailed Architecture for Proposal 1: Cython/Numba Integration

##### Integration Strategy
The strategy focuses on identifying and prioritizing performance-critical paths in PlexiChat's async architecture, then selectively compiling them using Cython for static compilation or Numba for JIT optimization. Prioritization is based on profiling data from existing performance modules (e.g., `core/performance/microsecond_optimizer.py`) and hot spots in async I/O, clustering, caching, and P2P operations. Key paths include:

- **Async I/O in Message Handling**: Target `core/services/message_service.py` for message serialization/deserialization loops and async queue processing. Use Numba for pure Python loops in event-driven message routing, wrapping async calls in `asyncio.to_thread` to maintain compatibility with FastAPI's event loop.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: In `core/clustering/cluster_manager.py`, optimize graph-based node discovery and consensus algorithms (e.g., hot loops for neighbor selection in P2P clusters). Cythonize distance calculations and matrix operations for ARM/x86 cross-compilation, ensuring PostgreSQL query integration via SQLAlchemy's async session wrappers.
- **Caching Operations**: Enhance `core/performance/multi_tier_cache.py` by compiling eviction policies and hash computations with Numba's `@njit(parallel=True)` for multi-threaded cache invalidation, preserving async locks via `asyncio.Lock` in Python wrappers.
- **P2P Messaging**: For `infrastructure/services/p2p_messaging.py`, target cryptographic handshakes and packet assembly in `node_manager.py`-linked functions. Use Cython to compile low-level socket buffering, with async wrappers for `asyncio.create_task` to handle Windows-specific Winsock compatibility.
- **Additional Hot Paths**: Extend to `core/performance/resource_manager.py` for resource allocation loops and `shared/models.py` for SQL query builders (non-async parts only, e.g., predicate evaluation). Avoid compiling full async def functions; instead, extract CPU-bound inner functions for selective optimization.

Handling Async Code: Leverage Cython's experimental async support (`cdef async def`) for direct compilation where possible, or use Numba's object mode with `numba.experimental.jitclass` for typed classes. For cross-compilation on Windows 11 with PostgreSQL, build extensions via `setuptools` with MSVC compiler flags (`/O2` for optimization), testing dialect consistency in SQLite dev env before prod migration.

##### File Structure
- **Core Utility Module**: Create `src/plexichat/infrastructure/utils/compilation.py` as a central registry for optimizers:
  - Define an `OptimizerRegistry` class (typed with MyPy) to register Cython/Numba decorators dynamically.
  - Include functions like `register_cython_extension(module_path: str, functions: List[str]) -> None` for build-time scanning.
  - Integrate with existing `core/performance` utils, e.g., via `from core.performance.microsecond_optimizer import profile_hot_paths`.
- **Build Configurations**:
  - Update `pyproject.toml`: Add `[build-system]` with `requires = ["setuptools", "cython", "numba"]`; under `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` include `packages = ["plexichat.infrastructure.utils"]`.
  - Enhance `Makefile`: Add targets like `cythonize: python setup.py build_ext --inplace` and `numba-cache: python -m numba.pycc -compile`.
  - New Directory: `scripts/compilation/` for build scripts, e.g., `build_extensions.py` to automate cythonize/numba compilation and `cross_compile.py` for Windows/PostgreSQL wheel generation using `cibuildwheel`.
- **Extension Modules**: Place compiled `.pyx` files alongside Python sources (e.g., `core/clustering/cluster_manager.pyx` for Cython targets), with `.pxd` headers for type declarations.

##### Dependencies
- **Add to pyproject.toml**: Under `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`, include `cython = "^3.0.0"`, `numba = "^0.60.0"`, `llvmlite = "^0.42.0"` (Numba backend). Pin for reproducibility: `cython = "3.0.11"`.
- **Compatibility**: Generate MyPy stubs for compiled extensions using `stubgen` or manual `.pyi` files (e.g., `core/clustering/cluster_manager.pyi`). Ensure Ruff ignores compiled files via `.ruff.toml` excludes (`*.so`, `*.pyd`). Test MyPy with `--namespace-packages` for async type checking. No conflicts expected with SQLAlchemy 2.0 async; validate via `mypy --strict src/`.

##### Testing Plan
- **Pytest Extensions**: Create `tests/performance/benchmark_compiled.py` with asyncio fixtures:
  - `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async benchmarks, using `asv` (air-speed-velocity) or `pytest-benchmark` to compare compiled vs. interpreted execution (e.g., `timeit` on message_service loops).
  - Coverage: Target 80% for optimized paths via `pytest-cov --cov=src/plexichat/core --cov-report=html`, including compiled modules by instrumenting wrappers.
  - Load Testing: Integrate `locust` for 1000 concurrent requests to endpoints like `/messages`, measuring speedup in SQL query compilation (SQLite vs. PostgreSQL).
- **Validation**: Add parametrized tests: `pytest -k "compiled" --benchmark-compare=baseline` to assert >15% speedup. Handle Windows-specific issues with `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32")` for non-portable Numba kernels.

##### Roadmap for Proposal 1
- **Phase 1: Design and Setup (1 week)**: Finalize optimizer registry in `compilation.py`, update pyproject.toml/Makefile. Dependencies: None. Metrics: Successful dry-run build (`python setup.py build_ext --dry-run`), MyPy passes on stubs.
- **Phase 2: Prototype One Module (1-2 weeks)**: Implement in `core/services/message_service.py` (e.g., Numba for serialization). Dependencies: Phase 1. Metrics: 20% speedup in isolated benchmarks, 80% coverage, async compatibility verified via `pytest tests/core/services/`.
- **Phase 3: Full Integration (2 weeks)**: Extend to 4-5 modules (cluster_manager, multi_tier_cache, p2p_messaging, resource_manager). Dependencies: Phase 2 prototype. Metrics: End-to-end tests pass, cross-platform wheels build (Windows/Linux via Docker).
- **Phase 4: Benchmarks and Iteration (1 week)**: Run load tests, profile with `cProfile` + Numba inspector. Dependencies: Phase 3. Metrics: Overall 20-30% speedup in message handling/P2P discovery, <5% regression in async throughput; integrate with static analysis (Proposal 3) for type safety.
- **Post-Integration**: Monitor via `core/performance` hooks; phased rollout with git commits per module.

This architecture ensures seamless integration, preserving PlexiChat's async-first design while delivering measurable performance gains.

2. **Build Pipeline Enhancements with Docker and Make**:
   - Extend Makefile with targets:
     - `make compile-native`: Builds optimized wheels using `cibuildwheel` for multi-platform (Linux x86_64, ARM, Windows).
     - `make benchmark-compile`: Runs `pytest` with `--cov` on compiled vs. interpreted code, measuring async query times in SQLAlchemy pipelines.
     - `make docker-build`: Uses multi-stage Dockerfiles (place `Dockerfile` in project root) to compile in a builder stage (e.g., Python 3.12-slim with Cython), then copy to runtime image with FastAPI/uvicorn.
   - Docker Integration: Use for reproducible builds aligning with PostgreSQL prod env.

#### Detailed Architecture for Proposal 2: Docker/Make Build Pipeline Enhancements

##### Docker Strategy
The Docker strategy employs multi-stage builds to ensure reproducible environments across development, testing, and production, addressing current gaps in containerization, Windows/PostgreSQL compatibility, and Cython/Numba integration. This approach isolates build-time dependencies (e.g., Cython compilers, MSVC for Windows) from runtime, minimizing image size while supporting cross-platform builds.

- **Multi-Stage Dockerfile Structure** (root `Dockerfile`):
  - **Base Stage**: Use `python:3.11-slim` (or 3.12 for future-proofing) as the foundation, installing system dependencies like `build-essential` (Linux), `gcc` for Cython compilation, and `libpq-dev` for PostgreSQL connectors. Align with pyproject.toml for Python 3.11+ compatibility.
  - **Dev Stage**: Extend base with dev dependencies (`pip install -e ".[dev]"` including Cython, Numba, pytest-benchmark). Include Cython build step: `pip install cython && python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to generate `.so`/`.pyd` files from existing `.pyx` targets (e.g., cluster_manager.pyx). Mount volumes for source code (`-v $(pwd):/app`) and databases (SQLite file or PostgreSQL socket).
  - **Prod Stage**: Minimal runtime image from base, installing only runtime deps (`pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt` with pinned versions, e.g., FastAPI==0.104.1, SQLAlchemy==2.0.23). Copy compiled artifacts (`.so`/`.pyd` from dev stage) via `COPY --from=dev /app/src/plexichat/core/clustering/*.so /app/src/plexichat/core/clustering/`. Exclude dev tools; use `psycopg2-binary` for PostgreSQL without build deps. Support SQLite fallback via env var `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db`.
  - **Windows Support**: Leverage Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds (`docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,windows/amd64 .`). On Windows 11 host, use WSL2 backend for Linux images; for native Windows images, optional separate `Dockerfile.windows` with `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore` base, but prioritize Linux containers for consistency. Handle path issues (e.g., `/` vs. `\`) via Python's `pathlib`.
  - **Database Handling**: In dev, use volumes for SQLite (`-v plexichat.db:/app/app.db`) or docker-compose-linked PostgreSQL. Prod uses env-injected `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/plexichat`), ensuring SQLAlchemy dialect auto-detection with async support (`create_async_engine`).

Benefits: Ensures zero environment diffs between dev/prod (e.g., no SQLite/PostgreSQL mismatches in query compilation), supports Cython cross-compilation (e.g., ARM .so for edge nodes), and reduces image size by 70% (dev ~1.5GB, prod ~300MB).

##### Makefile Integration
Extend the existing Makefile to chain Docker operations with current targets, enabling seamless workflows like building, compiling Cython, testing, and serving without manual commands. All targets use Docker for isolation, preserving host cleanliness on Windows 11.

- **New Targets**:
  - `docker-build`: `docker build -t plexichat-dev -f Dockerfile .` (builds dev image); add `--target prod -t plexichat-prod` variant for production.
  - `docker-cythonize`: `docker run --rm -v $(PWD):/app -w /app plexichat-dev make cythonize` (runs existing/proposed Cython target inside container, mounting sources for artifact persistence).
  - `docker-test`: `docker run --rm -v $(PWD):/app -w /app plexichat-dev pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/plexichat --cov-report=html` (runs tests with coverage; add `--benchmark-only` for Cython vs. host comparisons).
  - `docker-serve`: `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db -v $(PWD)/app.db:/app/app.db plexichat-dev uvicorn plexichat.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload` (dev server with SQLite volume; for PostgreSQL, link via docker-compose).
  - `docker-dev`: Chain: `make docker-build && docker run --rm -it -v $(PWD):/app -p 8000:8000 plexichat-dev /bin/bash -c "pip install -e '.[dev]' && make cythonize && uvicorn plexichat.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload"` (full dev setup).
  - `docker-benchmark`: `docker run --rm -v $(PWD):/app plexichat-dev pytest tests/performance/benchmark_compiled.py --benchmark-compare=host` (compares container vs. host metrics, ensuring <5% variance).
  - `docker-push`: `docker build -t plexichat-prod . --target prod && docker push your-registry/plexichat-prod:latest` (for CI/CD).

Integration with Existing: Prefix current targets, e.g., `docker-ruff: docker run --rm -v $(PWD):/app plexichat-dev ruff check src/ --fix`. Use `.PHONY` for all; add variables like `DOCKER_TAG ?= plexichat-dev` for flexibility.

##### CI/CD Alignment
Align with GitHub Actions for automated, multi-platform pipelines, building on existing `.github/workflows/` (assume ci.yml exists; create `docker.yml`).

- **.github/workflows/docker.yml**:
  - Triggers: `push` to main/feat branches, `pull_request`.
  - Jobs:
    - `build`: Matrix over platforms (linux/amd64, linux/arm64); `docker/build-push-action@v5` with Buildx for multi-arch, QEMU for emulation (`docker/setup-qemu-action`). Builds dev/prod images, runs `make docker-cythonize`.
    - `test`: `docker run plexichat-dev make docker-test`, asserts coverage >80%, includes benchmark assertions (e.g., Cython speedup >15%).
    - `push`: On main push, tag/push to registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry); uses secrets for auth.
  - Integration: Call from ci.yml as sub-workflow; add QEMU setup (`docker/setup-qemu-action`) for ARM testing without native hardware. Future: Self-hosted Windows runners for native Windows builds.

This ensures consistent builds across PRs, with artifacts for failed runs.

##### Security/Optimization
- **Security**: Run as non-root user (`USER appuser` in Dockerfile, created via `adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser`); scan with `docker scout` or Trivy in CI. Use `.dockerignore` to exclude `.git`, `*.pyd` sources, secrets (`.env`, `vaults/`), large files (benchmarks data).
- **Optimization**: Multi-platform via Buildx/QEMU (emulate ARM on x86 host); layer caching (`--cache-from` in CI); env vars for DB (`DATABASE_URL`), logging (`LOG_LEVEL=INFO`). Compress images with `docker-squash`; target build time <5min via parallel stages.
- **Windows Compat**: Buildx handles Windows tags; test PostgreSQL connectivity via linked compose service.

##### Testing Plan
- **Containerized Pytest**: All tests run in Docker (`make docker-test`), including async fixtures (`pytest-asyncio`) and coverage (`pytest-cov`). Parametrize for DB backends: `@pytest.mark.parametrize("db", ["sqlite", "postgres"])` with env injection.
- **Benchmarking**: `make docker-benchmark` vs. host (`make benchmark-compile`); measure Cython speedup in container (e.g., cluster_manager loops), SQLAlchemy query times (SQLite dev vs. PostgreSQL prod). Assert <5% env diff, 80% coverage via reports.
- **Load Testing**: Integrate Locust in Docker: `docker run plexichat-dev locust -f tests/load/test_endpoints.py --users 1000 --spawn-rate 10`, targeting <100ms response for `/messages`.
- **Cross-Platform**: Use QEMU in CI for ARM tests; manual `docker buildx build --load --platform linux/arm64` on dev machine.

##### File Structure
- **Root**: `Dockerfile` (multi-stage), `docker-compose.yml` for dev (services: app with depends_on postgres; postgres: image=postgres:15, env POSTGRES_DB=plexichat, volumes for persistence).
- **docker/ Dir** (if complex): `entrypoint.sh` (runs `make cythonize && uvicorn ...`), `postgres-init.sql` for schema.
- **Updates**: Enhance `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with Docker instructions (build/serve/prod deploy to Kubernetes/ECS); add section on `docker-compose up` for local dev with PostgreSQL.
- **gitignore**: Add `*.db`, `plexichat-*.whl` if built locally.

##### Roadmap for Proposal 2
- **Phase 1: Dockerfile Prototype (1 week)**: Create multi-stage Dockerfile, test basic build (`docker build -t test .`), verify Cython copy. Dependencies: Post-Proposal 1 (Cython files exist). Metrics: Images build <2min, .so files present in prod stage.
- **Phase 2: Makefile Targets (1 week)**: Add 5+ targets, integrate with existing (e.g., docker-test runs pytest). Dependencies: Phase 1. Metrics: `make docker-dev` launches server accessible at localhost:8000, tests pass in container.
- **Phase 3: Container Testing/Benchmarks (1-2 weeks)**: Implement docker-compose for DB, run benchmarks/CI prototype. Dependencies: Phase 2. Metrics: 80% coverage in Docker, Cython speedup consistent (<5% diff vs. host), PostgreSQL queries validate.
- **Phase 4: CI/CD Workflow (1 week)**: Create docker.yml, test on PR. Dependencies: Phase 3 (local success). Metrics: Green Actions runs multi-platform, images pushed on main, build time <5min.
- **Post-Integration**: Monitor via CI badges; phased git commits (e.g., "Add Dockerfile multi-stage", "Integrate Makefile docker targets"). Dependencies: After Proposal 1 (Cython), before Proposal 3 (static analysis). Overall Metrics: Consistent envs (zero test flakes), reproducible builds across Windows/Linux/ARM.

This architecture delivers a robust, secure pipeline that enhances PlexiChat's deployability while integrating seamlessly with compilation optimizations.

3. **Static Analysis Extension to Compilation-Time Checks**:
   - Enhance MyPy with `mypy --strict --disallow-untyped-defs src/` to flag async/SQLAlchemy incompatibilities (e.g., non-awaitable returns in `core/services/typing_service.py`).
   - Ruff Extension: Add rules for build deps (e.g., `ruff check --select=BUILD src/`) and integrate with pre-commit hooks for compilation simulation.
   - New Tool: Introduce `pyright` (via pyrightconfig.json) for faster IDE-time checks, and `sqlfluff` for SQLAlchemy query linting during build.

4. **Testing Compilation Under Load**:
   - Add pytest fixtures for load simulation: Use `pytest-asyncio` with `locust` integration to test compiled endpoints (e.g., `/ws` in `interfaces/web/websocket.py`) under 1000 concurrent async requests.
   - Metrics: Track compilation time, error rates in FastAPI dependency injection, and SQLAlchemy session pooling efficiency. Target <5% variance between dev (SQLite) and prod (PostgreSQL) configs.

## QEMU Enablement Section

### Overview and Rationale

QEMU will enable emulation of diverse architectures for testing PlexiChat's clustering, P2P, and sharding features in isolated environments. This is critical for edge deployments (ARM) and cross-platform validation, especially given Windows 11 dev env and Linux prod targets. QEMU provides lightweight virtualization without full hypervisor overhead, aligning with plugin sandboxing in `core/plugins/sandbox.py`. Place QEMU-related scripts in a new `scripts/` directory (e.g., `scripts/qemu-emulate.ps1` for Windows).

### Integration Plan

1. **QEMU Setup for Architecture Emulation**:
   - Supported Targets: x86_64 (standard cloud), ARM64 (edge/IoT for P2P nodes), RISC-V (future-proofing sharding).
   - Installation: Add QEMU to dev requirements (`qemu-system-x86_64`, `qemu-system-aarch64` via system package manager or Docker image `qemu`). On Windows 11, use WSL2 for native support or Chocolatey (`choco install qemu`).
   - Emulation Scripts: Create `scripts/qemu-emulate.sh` (Bash) and `scripts/qemu-emulate.ps1` (PowerShell for Windows) to launch VMs with PlexiChat Docker image mounted. Example: `qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -m 2G -drive file=plexichat.img,format=raw -netdev user,id=net0 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0`.

2. **Running PlexiChat in QEMU VMs for Feature Testing**:
   - Clustering/P2P/Sharding: Spin up multi-VM clusters (e.g., 3x ARM nodes) to test `core/clustering/cluster_manager.py` failover and `infrastructure/p2p_messaging` discovery. Use QEMU's `-serial stdio` for log forwarding to host.
   - Isolated Testing: For plugins (`plugins/security_toolkit`), run in QEMU with restricted networking to validate sandbox isolation against `core/security/zero_trust.py`.
   - Async/SQLAlchemy Validation: Boot VMs with PostgreSQL emulation, test query compilation in emulated env to catch arch-specific issues (e.g., ARM floating-point in Numba-optimized crypto).

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - GitHub Actions: Extend `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with QEMU jobs using `docker run --platform linux/arm64 qemu`. Matrix strategy for arches (x86_64, arm64).
   - Workflow Steps: Build wheel → QEMU boot → Run `pytest tests/` → Test P2P connectivity via emulated network. Use artifacts for VM snapshots.

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Isolated Environments: QEMU VMs for plugin testing enforce `core/plugins/security_manager.py` hooks, preventing host escapes. Enable KVM acceleration (`-enable-kvm`) for prod-like perf where available (WSL2 on Windows).
   - Threat Model Alignment: Integrate with `docs/SEC_threat_model.md` by emulating attack vectors (e.g., ARM-specific buffer overflows in P2P).

5. **Deployment Scripts for QEMU-Based Staging**:
   - Staging Pipeline: `make qemu-stage`: Builds image, launches QEMU cluster, deploys PlexiChat via `ansible` or `docker-compose` inside VMs.
   - Rollout: Scripts to snapshot VMs pre/post-update, enabling canary testing per `core/versioning/canary_node_selector.py`. Integrate with existing versioning module.

Total Estimated Effort: 7-10 weeks. Success Metrics: 30% overall perf gain, cross-arch compatibility, zero compilation errors in CI.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Performance Overhead in QEMU**: Emulation can slow tests by 20-50%. Mitigation: Use hardware acceleration (KVM/HVF in WSL2) and limit to CI; fallback to native for dev.
- **Compilation Compatibility (Windows/PostgreSQL)**: Cython may fail on Windows paths; SQLAlchemy dialects mismatch. Mitigation: Cross-compile in Docker/Linux, use SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` with explicit dialects in tests.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Numba/Cython with async libs. Mitigation: Pin versions in requirements.txt, isolate in virtualenv.
- **CI Resource Limits**: QEMU in GitHub Actions may timeout. Mitigation: Optimize VM sizes (e.g., 1G RAM), use self-hosted runners for heavy tests.
- **Security Exposure**: QEMU networking leaks. Mitigation: Run with `--net none` for isolated tests, audit with `core/security/waf_middleware.py`.
- **Async Code Overhead in QEMU**: Emulation may amplify event loop contention in FastAPI/SQLAlchemy. Mitigation: Profile with `asyncio-profiler` in VMs, optimize hot async paths pre-emulation; target <10% additional latency.

This plan ensures scalable, secure enhancements while preserving PlexiChat's async-first architecture.
