# Security Risk Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This document contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for unavoidable security risks in the PlexiChat system. Each ADR documents a specific security risk that cannot be completely eliminated, along with the mitigation strategies implemented to manage and minimize the risk.

## ADR-SEC-001: P2P Peer Impersonation Risk

### Context
PlexiChat operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) system where nodes communicate directly with each other for shard distribution and backup operations. This decentralized architecture inherently carries the risk of peer impersonation attacks where malicious actors could pose as legitimate peers to intercept, modify, or disrupt communications.

### Risk Assessment
- **Likelihood**: High (P2P networks are inherently vulnerable to Sybil attacks)
- **Impact**: Critical (Could lead to data compromise, system disruption, or complete takeover)
- **Detectability**: Medium (Requires sophisticated monitoring and anomaly detection)
- **Exploitability**: High (Well-known attack vectors in P2P systems)

### Decision
**Accepted Risk**: P2P peer impersonation cannot be completely eliminated due to the decentralized nature of the system.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Multi-Factor Peer Authentication
```python
# Implementation in shard distribution security
class PeerAuthenticator:
    def authenticate_peer(self, peer_id: str, credentials: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        # Verify cryptographic identity
        identity_valid = self.verify_cryptographic_identity(peer_id, credentials)

        # Check reputation score
        reputation_valid = self.check_peer_reputation(peer_id)

        # Validate network behavior
        behavior_valid = self.validate_network_behavior(peer_id)

        # Require all factors to pass
        return identity_valid and reputation_valid and behavior_valid
```

#### 2. Cryptographic Identity Verification
- **Post-Quantum Digital Signatures**: Dilithium-5 signatures for peer identity
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: X.509 certificates with HSM-backed private keys
- **Key Distribution**: Shamir's Secret Sharing for master key distribution
- **Identity Rotation**: Time-based identity key rotation (24-hour intervals)

#### 3. Reputation-Based Trust System
```python
class PeerReputationManager:
    def calculate_reputation_score(self, peer_id: str) -> float:
        factors = {
            'uptime': self.get_uptime_score(peer_id),
            'data_integrity': self.get_data_integrity_score(peer_id),
            'network_behavior': self.get_network_behavior_score(peer_id),
            'community_votes': self.get_community_vote_score(peer_id)
        }

        # Weighted scoring algorithm
        return sum(factor * weight for factor, weight in factors.items())
```

#### 4. Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Monitor for unusual communication patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-peer rate limits to prevent flooding attacks
- **Geographic Distribution Checks**: Verify peer locations match expected patterns
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Detect temporal anomalies in peer behavior

#### 5. Consensus-Based Validation
```python
class ShardConsensusValidator:
    def validate_shard_operation(self, operation: ShardOperation) -> bool:
        # Collect votes from multiple trusted peers
        votes = self.collect_peer_votes(operation, min_peers=5)

        # Require supermajority consensus
        consensus_threshold = len(votes) * 0.67
        positive_votes = sum(1 for vote in votes if vote.approved)

        return positive_votes >= consensus_threshold
```

### Monitoring and Response
- **Real-time Alerts**: Automated alerts for suspicious peer behavior
- **Automated Isolation**: Temporary isolation of suspicious peers
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed logging for post-incident analysis
- **Community Reporting**: User reporting system for suspicious activity

### Risk Acceptance Criteria
- Maximum acceptable impersonation success rate: < 0.1%
- Mean time to detect impersonation: < 5 minutes
- False positive rate for legitimate peers: < 1%

## ADR-SEC-002: Cryptographic Key Exposure Risk

### Context
The system relies heavily on cryptographic keys for encryption, digital signatures, and authentication. Despite robust key management practices, there is always a risk of key exposure through various attack vectors including side-channel attacks, implementation flaws, or insider threats.

### Risk Assessment
- **Likelihood**: Medium (Multiple attack vectors but strong protections in place)
- **Impact**: Critical (Could compromise all encrypted data and communications)
- **Detectability**: Low (Key exposure may be silent until exploited)
- **Exploitability**: High (Exposed keys can be used immediately)

### Decision
**Accepted Risk**: Complete elimination of key exposure risk is impossible due to the fundamental nature of cryptographic systems.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration
```python
# HSM-backed key operations
class HSMKeyManager:
    async def generate_secure_key(self, key_type: KeyType) -> HSMKey:
        # Generate key inside HSM
        key = await self.hsm.generate_key(
            key_type=key_type,
            security_level=SecurityLevel.QUANTUM_SAFE
        )

        # Never expose private key material
        return key

    def perform_encryption(self, data: bytes, key_id: str) -> bytes:
        # All crypto operations happen inside HSM
        return self.hsm.encrypt(data, key_id)
```

#### 2. Key Fragmentation and Distribution
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing**: Split master keys into multiple shares
- **Geographic Distribution**: Store shares in different physical locations
- **Threshold Requirements**: Require minimum shares for key reconstruction
- **Share Rotation**: Regular rotation of key shares

#### 3. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
```python
class ForwardSecrecyManager:
    def establish_secure_session(self, peer_id: str) -> SessionKeys:
        # Generate ephemeral key pair for each session
        ephemeral_keys = self.generate_ephemeral_keys()

        # Perform key exchange
        shared_secret = self.perform_key_exchange(ephemeral_keys, peer_id)

        # Derive session keys
        session_keys = self.derive_session_keys(shared_secret)

        # Schedule key destruction after session
        self.schedule_key_destruction(ephemeral_keys, delay=timedelta(hours=24))

        return session_keys
```

#### 4. Key Usage Monitoring and Limits
```python
class KeyUsageMonitor:
    def track_key_usage(self, key_id: str, operation: str):
        # Increment usage counter
        self.usage_counters[key_id] += 1

        # Check against limits
        if self.usage_counters[key_id] > self.max_usage[key_id]:
            self.trigger_key_rotation(key_id)

        # Log usage for audit
        self.audit_log.log_key_usage(key_id, operation)
```

#### 5. Quantum-Resistant Algorithms
- **Post-Quantum Key Exchange**: ML-KEM (Kyber) for key encapsulation
- **Quantum-Safe Signatures**: Dilithium for digital signatures
- **Hybrid Cryptography**: Classical + post-quantum algorithm combinations
- **Algorithm Agility**: Ability to switch algorithms as threats evolve

### Detection and Response
- **Key Usage Anomalies**: Monitor for unusual key usage patterns
- **Compromise Detection**: Cryptographic proof of key compromise
- **Emergency Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation upon compromise detection
- **Backup Key Activation**: Secure activation of backup key sets

### Risk Acceptance Criteria
- Maximum key exposure window: < 1 hour
- Key rotation time: < 5 minutes
- System availability during key rotation: > 99.9%

## ADR-SEC-003: Insider Threat Risk

### Context
Insider threats pose a significant risk to any system, particularly one handling sensitive communications and data. Authorized users with legitimate access could intentionally or unintentionally compromise security through malicious actions, negligence, or coercion.

### Risk Assessment
- **Likelihood**: Medium (Depends on user vetting and monitoring effectiveness)
- **Impact**: Critical (Insiders have legitimate access to sensitive systems)
- **Detectability**: Low (Insiders can appear legitimate until detected)
- **Exploitability**: High (Authorized access bypasses many external controls)

### Decision
**Accepted Risk**: Insider threats cannot be completely eliminated due to the need for human access to systems.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
```python
class ZeroTrustEnforcer:
    def validate_access(self, user_id: str, resource: str, action: str) -> bool:
        # Continuous verification
        identity_valid = self.verify_identity(user_id)
        context_valid = self.validate_context(user_id)
        behavior_valid = self.analyze_behavior(user_id, action)

        # Risk-based access control
        risk_score = self.calculate_risk_score(user_id, resource, action)

        # Require additional authentication for high-risk actions
        if risk_score > self.high_risk_threshold:
            return self.perform_step_up_authentication(user_id)

        return identity_valid and context_valid and behavior_valid
```

#### 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging
```python
class SecurityAuditSystem:
    def log_security_event(self, event: SecurityEvent):
        # Log all security-relevant actions
        audit_entry = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
            'user_id': event.user_id,
            'action': event.action,
            'resource': event.resource,
            'ip_address': event.ip_address,
            'user_agent': event.user_agent,
            'risk_score': self.calculate_event_risk(event),
            'anomaly_score': self.detect_anomalies(event)
        }

        # Store in tamper-proof audit log
        self.secure_audit_store.append(audit_entry)

        # Real-time alerting for high-risk events
        if audit_entry['risk_score'] > self.alert_threshold:
            self.trigger_security_alert(audit_entry)
```

#### 3. Behavioral Analytics and Anomaly Detection
```python
class UserBehaviorAnalyzer:
    def analyze_user_behavior(self, user_id: str) -> BehaviorProfile:
        # Build baseline behavior profile
        baseline = self.build_behavior_baseline(user_id)

        # Analyze current behavior
        current_behavior = self.collect_current_behavior(user_id)

        # Detect anomalies
        anomalies = self.detect_behavioral_anomalies(baseline, current_behavior)

        # Calculate risk score
        risk_score = self.calculate_behavior_risk_score(anomalies)

        return BehaviorProfile(
            user_id=user_id,
            risk_score=risk_score,
            anomalies=anomalies,
            confidence_score=self.calculate_confidence(baseline, current_behavior)
        )
```

#### 4. Principle of Least Privilege
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Minimal permissions for each role
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary privilege elevation for specific tasks
- **Access Reviews**: Regular review and adjustment of user permissions
- **Privilege Separation**: Different credentials for different functions

#### 5. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
```python
class DataLossPrevention:
    def monitor_data_exfiltration(self, user_id: str, data_access: DataAccess):
        # Analyze data access patterns
        access_pattern = self.analyze_access_pattern(data_access)

        # Check for sensitive data
        sensitivity_score = self.assess_data_sensitivity(data_access.data)

        # Detect exfiltration attempts
        exfiltration_risk = self.detect_exfiltration_risk(access_pattern, sensitivity_score)

        if exfiltration_risk > self.exfiltration_threshold:
            self.block_data_access(user_id, data_access)
            self.trigger_security_incident(user_id, "potential_data_exfiltration")
```

### Detection and Response

```python
class SBOMManager:
    def generate_sbom(self) -> SBOM:
        # Scan all dependencies
        dependencies = self.scan_dependencies()

        # Generate comprehensive SBOM
        sbom = {
            'components': dependencies,
            'vulnerabilities': self.check_vulnerabilities(dependencies),
            'licenses': self.analyze_licenses(dependencies),
            'integrity_hashes': self.calculate_integrity_hashes(dependencies)
        }

        return sbom

    def verify_dependency_integrity(self, dependency: str) -> bool:
        # Verify against known good hashes
        expected_hash = self.get_expected_hash(dependency)
        actual_hash = self.calculate_hash(dependency)

        return expected_hash == actual_hash
```

#### 2. Automated Vulnerability Scanning
```python
class VulnerabilityScanner:
    def scan_dependencies(self) -> List[Vulnerability]:
        # Use multiple vulnerability databases
        sources = [
            self.scan_nvd(),
            self.scan_oss_index(),
            self.scan_snyk(),
            self.scan_github_advisories()
        ]

        # Correlate findings
        vulnerabilities = self.correlate_vulnerabilities(sources)

        # Prioritize by severity and exploitability
        return self.prioritize_vulnerabilities(vulnerabilities)
```
