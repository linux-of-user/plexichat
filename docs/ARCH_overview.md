### Module Responsibility Guidelines
- **Core Layer**: Foundational services only - no business logic
- **Features Layer**: Business domain logic - isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Supporting services - abstracted from business logic
- **Interfaces Layer**: API boundaries - thin layer over core/features
