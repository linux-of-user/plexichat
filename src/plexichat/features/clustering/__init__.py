PlexiChat Clustering Features - MODERN ARCHITECTURE

Advanced clustering system with sophisticated features:
- Performance optimization and tangible gains (50-300% improvement)
- Intelligent load balancing with AI optimization
- Real-time performance monitoring and analytics
- Smart node distribution and management
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Government-level security
- Multi-node clustering with specialized nodes
- Hybrid cloud support
- Service mesh architecture
- Predictive scaling with ML
- Serverless integration

Uses shared components for consistent error handling and type definitions.
