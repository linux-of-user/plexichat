1. Backend Model Changes
a. User Model
Add a custom_fields: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict) to the User dataclass (and/or SQLModel).
Store these as a JSON column in the database.
b. Message Model
Add a custom_fields: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default={}, sa_column=Column(JSON)) to the Message SQLModel/dataclass.
2. API/Service Layer
Add endpoints for:
Adding/updating custom fields for a user or message.
Retrieving all custom fields, with type information.
Validate and serialize/deserialize custom fields as JSON, supporting types: string, int, float, bool, list, dict, datetime.
3. WebUI/GUI
Add a UI component for users/admins to add new custom fields (name, type, value) to their profile or messages.
Render all custom fields in the profile/message view.
Allow admins to define new field types globally (optional).
4. Retrieval Mechanism
When fetching a user or message, always include the custom_fields dict.
Provide a utility to cast values to their correct type based on a stored type descriptor.
5. Security & Validation
Validate field names (no SQL injection, XSS, reserved names).
Enforce per-user/admin limits on number and size of custom fields.
Log all schema changes and custom field additions.
6. Implementation Steps
Backend:
Update User and Message models to include custom_fields.
Update DAO/repository to support CRUD for custom fields.
Add API endpoints for managing custom fields.
WebUI/GUI:
Add forms/components for adding/removing custom fields.
Display custom fields in profile/message views.
Retrieval:
Update API responses to always include custom fields.
Add utility for type-safe retrieval.

1. Global Rate Limiting
Use a global key (e.g., "global") for all requests, in addition to per-IP/user keys.
This ensures that if the total traffic exceeds a threshold, all requests are throttled.
2. Intelligent/Adaptive Scaling
Dynamically adjust max_attempts and window_minutes based on recent traffic patterns.
For example, if traffic spikes, temporarily lower the allowed rate; if traffic is low, relax the limits.
Use the get_stats() method to monitor traffic and adjust limits in real time.
3. How to Integrate
Add a FastAPI middleware or dependency that checks the global rate limit before processing any request.
Optionally, add logic to adjust the rate limit parameters based on rate_limiter.get_stats().
Example: FastAPI Middleware for Global Adaptive Rate Limiting
Apply to setup.py
Add this middleware to your FastAPI app (before any router).
You can further tune the adaptive logic to use moving averages, time of day, or other heuristics.
4. Next Steps
I can implement and inject this middleware into your main app, and ensure all endpoints are protected.
If you want, I can also add per-IP and per-user adaptive rate limiting for even finer control.
1. Why This Is Challenging
Standard TLS is the industry solution for MITM protection. Custom cryptography is almost always less secure than well-tested standards.
HTTP is inherently insecure: Even with time-based encryption, an attacker can intercept, replay, or tamper with traffic unless you control both client and server code and enforce strict key management.
Custom TLS is not recommended for production, but for research/educational purposes, you can layer additional encryption on top of HTTP.
2. What You Can Do (Best Practice)
Layered Encryption: Encrypt all payloads (requests and responses) with a time-based, ephemeral symmetric key, in addition to any transport security.
Key Exchange: Use a secure key exchange (e.g., ECDH) at the start of each session, and derive a session key that is rotated frequently (e.g., every minute).
Time-Based Key Derivation: Derive a new key every N seconds/minutes using a shared secret and the current time window.
Replay Protection: Include a nonce/timestamp in every message, and reject old or replayed messages.
Integrity: Use authenticated encryption (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305).
Custom TLS: If you want to implement a custom handshake, use a proven library and protocol as a base, and add your time-based key rotation on top.
3. How to Implement (Python/FastAPI Example)
a. Session Key Exchange
On first connection, client and server perform ECDH (or post-quantum Kyber) key exchange.
Both derive a shared secret.
b. Time-Based Key Derivation
Every minute (or N seconds), derive a new symmetric key:
Apply to setup.py
c. Encrypt/Decrypt Payloads
Before sending, encrypt the payload with the current time-based key (AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305).
Include a timestamp/nonce in the payload.
On receive, decrypt and verify the timestamp is within the allowed window.
d. API Endpoint Decorator
Write a FastAPI dependency or decorator that:
Decrypts incoming requests using the time-based key.
Encrypts outgoing responses.
Rejects requests with old timestamps or invalid MACs.
e. Custom TLS Layer (Optional)
If you want to go further, you can implement a custom handshake endpoint that negotiates the session key, and then require all further requests to be encrypted at the application layer.
4. Security.txt Reference
This approach aligns with the “Perfect Forward Secrecy”, “Key Rotation”, and “Quantum-Resistant Security” sections.
5. Next Steps
I can implement a proof-of-concept for this system in your FastAPI endpoints, including:
Key exchange endpoint (ECDH or Kyber)
Time-based key derivation
Request/response encryption/decryption middleware or dependency
Replay/timestamp protection
1. Current Direct SQL Usage
Direct sqlite3.connect and cursor.execute are found in:
src/plexichat/interfaces/web/routers/setup.py
src/plexichat/interfaces/web/core/auth_storage.py
src/plexichat/interfaces/gui/components/login_screen.py
src/plexichat/features/ai/monitoring/analytics_engine.py
src/plexichat/features/ai/moderation/feedback_collector.py
src/plexichat/features/ai/moderation/moderation_engine.py
src/plexichat/features/ai/moderation/training_system.py
src/plexichat/run.py
and others.
2. How to Use the Abstraction Layer
The abstraction layer is provided by classes like ConsolidatedDatabaseManager, BaseDAO, and AdvancedORM.
CRUD operations should use methods like:
dao.create(data)
dao.get_by_id(id)
dao.update(id, data)
dao.delete(id)
Or, for more advanced queries, use the repository pattern (BaseRepository).
Schema management (table creation) should use the ORM’s create_all or migration system, not raw SQL.
3. What Needs Refactoring
All direct sqlite3.connect and cursor.execute calls must be replaced with calls to the abstraction layer.
This means:
For setup and admin creation: use the DAO or repository for user creation, not raw SQL.
For any data access in features, analytics, moderation, etc.: use the DAO/repository for all CRUD and queries.
For schema creation: use the ORM’s migration or table creation utilities.
4. Next Steps
Refactor setup.py and auth_storage.py first, as these are security-critical and part of the web interface.
Remove all direct SQL and replace with abstraction layer calls.
If a DAO or repository does not exist for a model (e.g., User), create one using the patterns in core/database/dao/base_dao.py or core/database/repository/base_repository.py.
Ensure all other files (features, analytics, moderation, etc.) are similarly refactored
Global adaptive rate limiting is now enforced for all endpoints in setup.py using the existing rate_limiter. This ensures that all setup-related routes are protected against abuse and traffic spikes, in full compliance with security.txt and project conventions.
The dependency is applied to every endpoint, and the logic dynamically adjusts the allowed rate based on recent traffic.
This can be easily propagated to other routers for consistent global protection.
Next steps:
Apply this pattern to other critical routers and endpoints for consistent global rate limiting.
Continue with the full SQL abstraction refactor for all direct SQL usage in the codebase, as previously outlined.
Let me know if you want to proceed with these next steps or focus on another area!
The next step is to fully remove all direct SQL usage and ensure all database operations use the abstraction layer:
The previous attempt did not fully refactor setup.py (no changes were made), and only partially addressed auth_storage.py.
The correct approach is to:
Replace all sqlite3.connect and cursor.execute in setup.py with calls to the user/profile DAO/service (e.g., UserModelService).
Do the same for all authentication and settings CRUD in auth_storage.py, using the appropriate DAO/service.
Ensure all schema creation, inserts, updates, and queries use the abstraction layer, not raw SQL.
Would you like me to:
Refactor setup.py to use the abstraction layer for all user/admin/settings DB operations, and
Refactor auth_storage.py to use the abstraction layer for all authentication record CRUD?
This will make the codebase fully compliant with the project’s security and abstraction requirements. Please confirm, and I will proceed with the full code changes.
User and Message Models: Now support custom_fields (JSON/dict) for extensible, multi-datatype custom attributes, persisted in the database. This enables dynamic schema and user/admin extensibility for both profiles and messages.
Web API: MITM-resistant, time-based encryption utilities are implemented for sensitive endpoints. Payloads are encrypted/decrypted with a time-derived symmetric key (AES-GCM), with replay/timestamp protection, as per security.txt and cryptographic best practices.
Extensibility: The backend is ready for GUI/WebUI components to add, edit, and retrieve custom fields for users and messages, supporting any datatype.
Next steps:
Add API endpoints for managing custom fields (add, update, retrieve) for users and messages.
Add GUI/WebUI components for dynamic custom field management.
Integrate the MITM-resistant encryption dependency into all sensitive endpoints as needed.
Would you like to proceed with the API endpoints and UI, or focus on a specific area next?

er-user rate limiting is now enforced in setup.py and adapts based on user rank (admin, moderator, user, guest), in addition to global adaptive rate limiting. This approach is fully extensible and can be applied to all endpoints for robust, scalable, and fair API protection, as recommended in security.txt.
Next steps:
Apply this pattern to all other critical endpoints and routers.
If you want, I can propagate this logic to the rest of your web interface and API, or focus on a specific area next.
