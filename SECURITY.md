# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to our security team.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to version control**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Use .env files (excluded from git)
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Sanitize output

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement 2FA where possible
   - Follow principle of least privilege

4. **Secure Communication**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Use secure headers

5. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Scan for vulnerabilities regularly
   - Use trusted sources

## Automated Security Checks

This project includes automated security scanning:
- Hardcoded secret detection
- Dangerous function usage analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security configuration validation
