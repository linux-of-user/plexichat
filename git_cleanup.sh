🎯 Major Features Implemented:
- 1MB sharding with Reed-Solomon error correction (5+3 configuration)
- Individual shard encryption with unique AES-256-GCM keys
- Immutable versioning with message edit diffs
- Cross-user shard distribution with load balancing
- Complete REST API for shard management
- WebUI integration for backup and config management
- Unified configuration system

🗑️ Cleanup Completed:
- Removed 20+ fragmented backup files
- Consolidated 4 different config systems into one
- Eliminated duplicate and conflicting managers

🔧 New Components:
- ShardManager: 1MB chunks + Reed-Solomon encoding
- EncryptionManager: Per-shard encryption with unique keys
- VersionManager: Immutable versions + message diffs
- DistributionManager: Cross-user shard distribution
- API Endpoints: Complete REST API for all operations
- WebUI Routers: Backup and config management interfaces

📊 System Capabilities:
- Can restore from partial shards (any 5 of 8)
- Handles message edits as immutable diffs
- Distributes shards across multiple users/nodes
- Provides complete backup management through WebUI
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

🎉 Production Ready:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Real-time monitoring and verification
- Secure key management and storage
- Complete test suite and documentation"
